 1. USAGE                                                        *zenfinder-intro*

*:Zenfinder* is a minimalistic, file-centric fuzzy finder. It populates the
location list for you. You can then easily just navigate into those files, or
do operations on them, like you would normally do with any quickfix or
location list.

Trigger |:Zenfinder| with your mapping, or just using `:Zenfinder files` or `:Zenfinder
buffers`. You can also use *:zf* as an alias for |:Zenfinder|.

- Navigate your files by typing using fuzzy find.
- Choose the current file with `<C-j>` and `<C-k>` (`<C-n>` and `<C-p>` are also available)
- Press `<CR>` to open the file
- Use `<C-Tab>` to toggle between the prompt and the location list
- Use `:` to enter command line mode
- Filter the location list with `:Zfilter` and `:Zreject`
- Use `:ldo` to perform a command on all visible files
- Toggle fuzzy/regexp mode with `<C-r>`
- Use `x` and `d` to delete the current file under cursor

Here are a few usage examples:

Example 1:
>
  <leader>f            Invoke :Zenfinder, in file mode
  appmodperson         Type to fuzzy find the file in `app/models/person.rb`
                       Notice that its the only matching file
  <CR>                 Press ENTER, opening the file in the current active
                       window
  

Example 2:
>
  :zf                  Invoke :Zenfinder, in file mode
  appmodperson         Type to fuzzy find the file in `app/models/person.rb`
                       Notice that it also matches `app/models/person.rb.old`
  :                    Press `:`, enter in command line mode
  :Zreject .old        Reject all entries in the location file that match `.old`
  :ldo vsp             Open all in vertical splits

Example 3:
>
  <leader>b            Invoke :Zenfinder!, in buffer mode
  .md                  Type .md, and find all markdown files
  :                    Enter command line mode
  :ldo %s/replace this/with this/g

 2. CONFIGURATION                                        *zenfinder-configuration*

You can set the *g:zenfinder_command* variable to whatever command you want to
use, if you don't want to use `ripgrep`.

Below are a few examples:
>
  " by default, use ripgrep
  let g:zenfinder_command = 'rg %s --files --color=never --glob ""'

  " use ag, the silver searcher
  let g:zenfinder_command = 'ag %s -l --nocolor -g ""'

  " macOS/Linux
  let g:zenfinder_command = 'find %s -type f'

  " Windows
  let g:zenfinder_command = 'dir %s /-n /b /s /a-d'
<
By default, Zenfinder displays 9 files in the location list. For browsing
files, this is enough, but you can change this to whatever you want with the
*zenfinder_max_ll_files* variable:

>
  let g:zenfinder_max_ll_files = 9     " default
  let g:zenfinder_max_ll_files = 100   " 100 files max
  let g:zenfinder_max_ll_files = -1    " no limit
